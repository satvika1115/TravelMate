## Build Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Android SDK (API 36 / compileSdkVersion 36)
- Android SDK minimum API 24 (minSdkVersion 24)
- Java 21 (sourceCompatibility and targetCompatibility set to VERSION_21 in capacitor.build.gradle)
- Gradle 8.13.0 (AGP version in frontend/android/build.gradle)

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/satvika1115/TravelMate.git
cd TravelMate

# 2. Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# 3. Build the production web assets
npm run build

# 4. Sync Capacitor (copies dist/ into the Android project)
npx cap sync android

# 5. Build the Android APK
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The release APK will be produced at:
`frontend/android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

### F-Droid Build Recipe

The F-Droid recipe is at `com.swecha.travelmate.yml` in the repository root.

```yaml
subdir: frontend/android
gradle:
  - release
```

Note for F-Droid builders: The build requires the Capacitor web asset sync step before Gradle runs. This can be handled via a `prebuild` script or by ensuring the `frontend/android/app/src/main/assets/public/` directory is committed to the repository. Currently the web assets are not pre-committed; a `prebuild` entry may be needed in the recipe.

---

## Notes for Reviewers

1. **Web assets in Android build:** This is a Capacitor (Ionic) hybrid app. The Android project wraps a React/Vite web app. The bundled assets in `frontend/android/app/src/main/assets/public/` must be present before Gradle can build. The F-Droid build recipe may need a `prebuild` step:
   ```yaml
   prebuild:
     - cd ../../ && npm install && npm run build && npx cap sync android
   ```
   Verify this against the F-Droid server environment.

2. **Signing config in build.gradle:** The `build.gradle` contains a `signingConfigs.release` block referencing `travelmate-release.jks`. F-Droid ignores app-provided signing configs and re-signs with its own key. The keystore file is not committed to the repository.

3. **Permissions:** The app requests `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` and `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` for the "pick location on map" feature and GPS-based origin detection. These are runtime permissions; the app functions without them (manual address entry is supported).

4. **INTERNET permission:** Used for: Nominatim reverse geocoding (OpenStreetMap), OpenWeatherMap API calls for live weather/AQI, and Leaflet map tile loading. All external calls are optional; routing works fully offline.

5. **usesCleartextTraffic="true":** Present in AndroidManifest.xml for local development compatibility. For a production F-Droid build this should ideally be removed or restricted via a Network Security Config. This is a known beta limitation.

6. **No anti-features:** The app has no ads, no proprietary network services, no non-free dependencies, and no tracking. All GTFS data is bundled from official public feeds.

7. **Tag format:** Tags follow the pattern `v<semver>` (e.g., `v0.9.0-beta`). The `AutoUpdateMode` in the recipe is set to `Version v%v` accordingly.
